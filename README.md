# Pokemon Clustering
This project is about finding clusters in the set of pokemons

## Project plan
In order to achieve the objective I divide the project in four main parts
1. Scrape the dataset
2. Apply exploratory data analysis to understand what is behind the features and what to expect from the clusters
3. Apply multiple clustering techniques
    - K-Means
    - DBSCAN
    - HDBSCAN
4. Explain the clusters obtained in the previous section
