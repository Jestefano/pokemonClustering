# Pokemon Clustering
## About
This project is about finding clusters in the set of pokemons

## Motivation
The motivation behind this clusterization is the fact that I've been interested in competitive pokemon for a while, I have played in [pokemon showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/). The idea behind it is that you have to build a team (based on any pokemon that the rules allow) and from them you battle against other competitors.

This is a basic approach, based on the statistics of the pokemons, how can we cluster them so that we select the best among them? In this we have to take into consideration that there are pokemon that are banned, this might be a cluster. And there might be some clusters that are good in certain attribute compared to others. So this is what we expect.

## Key questions to answer


## Project plan
In order to achieve the objective I divide the project in four main parts
1. Scrape the dataset
2. Apply exploratory data analysis to understand what is behind the features and what to expect from the clusters
3. Apply multiple clustering techniques
    - K-Means
    - DBSCAN / HDBSCAN
4. Explain the clusters obtained in the previous section

## Results

## Next steps
There are some extra things that we can consider.
- Attacks
- Abilities
- Types
- Synergies between pokemon
